JFreeChart 1.2.0-ea1
--------------------
30 June 2009

This is an early access release of JFreeChart 1.2.0.  The main changes from 
JFreeChart 1.0.x are:

- removed JCommon dependency by copying required classes into the
      org.jfree.chart.* package namespace;
- dropped support for JDK 1.3.1, so that JDK 1.4.2 or later is now required;
- removed all deprecated code;
- added a selection mechanism to the ChartPanel class.

JFreeChart 1.2.0 will be released during 2009, but it has not been decided
yet exactly when the release will occur.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY BE FURTHER API CHANGES BEFORE THE FINAL 1.2.0 RELEASE.
